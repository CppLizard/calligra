* Make a complete Playback Device Context
   + The rest of the graphics state variables of the DC                 [DONE]
      - backgroundMode                                                  [done]

   + Move the object system (Pen, Brush, etc) to the DC
   + Move the current path to the DC                                    [DONE]
   + Move the world transform to the DC                                 [DONE]

   + (Implement a real saveDC and restoreDC) Wait until later

* Implement support for EMFPLUS
   + Make a stream from a EMR_COMMENT_EMFPLUS record and hand that
     to the EMF+ parser.
   + Implement the EMF+ device context
      - Find out what the EMF+ DC has that the EMF DC doesn't
      - Create an EMF+ DC from an EMF DC
   + Support EMF+ records
      - Check which calls are basically same as EMF, and copy code for them
      - One by one, add code to the ones that we don't support yet.
   + Enhance backend to support EMF+
      - Implement which backend calls we have to add to be able to support EMF+

* Merge with libkowmf
   - Rename to libwinmetafile (or wmf? But that could be confusing)


----------------------------------------------------------------
                              old todo's


* Complete doxygen \mainpage

* Check that our constructor / destructor / copy constructor arrangement
  for AbstractOutput follows best practice.

* Move all the debug stuff out into DebugOutput class

* Complete handling of EMR_EOF

* Figure out why the pyemf tests have the wrong number of records.

* Create a TextOutput class

* Create a RecorderOutput class

* Use RecorderOutput with an EMF writer to ensure we can "round trip"
  EMF files.

* Get examples of EMF files that use Extension 1 and 2, add to the unit tests.

* Fix temporary parser hacks:
   - EXTCREATEPEN

* Make emf_demo work properly.
   - Allow selection of zoom level

* Implement Painter operations:
   - setMapMode
   - remaining transform types
   - Handle remainder issues in CreateBrushIndirect
   - Handle SYSTEM_FONT stock object
   - Handle DEVICE_DEFAULT_FONT stock object
