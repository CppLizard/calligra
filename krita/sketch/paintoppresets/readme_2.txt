The package contains:
inking_brush
	A pressure sensitive pixelbrush, fine tuned to have sharp anti-	 	 aliasing on 100% view.
inking_dynamic_pen
	Similar to the brush, however, this brush requires more pressure to  		get full size out of.
inking_dynamic_pen_small
	Exactly the same as inking_dynamic_pen, but smaller in radius.
inking_dynamic_though
	Similar to previous brushes, but thougher and smaller than the 		inking_dynamic_pen, resulting in a more even line.
inking_fine_big,
inking_fine_mid,
inking_fine_small
	Pressure and speed sensitive pixel-brush with finetuned antialiasing. 		Each a slightly different radius.
inking_fine_tiny
	A tiny-radius bursh with good anti-aliasing.
inking_doodle_brush
	A colour smudge brush with pressure sensitivity for opacity and size. 
	Creates more gentle lines than the rest of the pack, good for digital 		painting
