Some usefull stuff:              
You can search the source code for FIXME and TODO entries with:
find . -name "*.c*" -o -name "*.h" | xargs grep -E "(###|TODO|FIXME|todo)"

Using -A and -B with grep gives you some additional context around the particular comment:
find . -name "*.c*" -o -name "*.h" | xargs grep -A 3 -B 3 -E "(###|TODO|FIXME|todo)"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In no partivular order or priority:

* Complete transition kplato -> plan
	Executable name
	Save to fileext .plan
	Namespace
	etc

* Improving printing of gantt chart:
	Proper task list
	Selected tasks
	Limited by dates

* Adding printing to performance charts (and to the rest of the missing views)

* Improving reports, it's very rudimentary
	More flexible data access ('query' builder?)
	Maybe drag-n-drop into Words?

* Improve rcps scheduler

* Import task data from spreadsheet (User request)

* Lock down some actions when a schedule is baselined. (Delete task, used resource ...)

* Improve the graphical dependency editor, it is difficult to use with many tasks/dependencies.

* Add a 'calendar' view for the resources (ala korganizer) to show appointments

* Add 'unindent' schedule (to top) in schedules editor for cases where you reschedule frequently

* Add possibility to automatically schedule after changes to the project.

* Improve report designer ui, it is not very user friendly (common with kexi. ref Adam Pigg)

* Add filter / sort to (some) views

* Improve gantt chart (note this is KDAB. so...)
	Time now
	Context menu on tasks in chart
	When selected in list, show selection in chart and vs (?)
	Remove the position diffrence of items in list and chart
	Position correctly on start/end datetime (small offset now)
