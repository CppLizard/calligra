/**
 * This class is the object that explains how a shape is anchored to something.
 *
 * The anchored shape will be positioned (in supporting applications) based on the properties
 * defined in this class.
 *
 * This class can be used in two different ways:
 *  -page anchor
 *  -as-char, char, paragraph anchor
 *
 * If it's a page anchor it just provide the info about how the shape relates to a page number.
 *
 * For the other types of anchoring it has to be inlined in the QTextDocument in which case the
 * anchor is the connection between the text and the so called 'anchored-shape', where the anchored
 * shape can be any kind of shape.  This textanchor then connects the anchored-shape to the text
 * flow so the anchored shape can be repositioned on the canvas if new text is inserted or removed
 * before the anchor character.
 *
 * The KoTextAnchor object is inserted in text, and is represented to the user as one invisible
 * character in the text flow. Since this is a real character it will be positioned by the text
 * -layout engine and * anything that will change the position of the text will thus also change
 * the KoTextAnchor character.
 * In such a case where the KoTextAnchor character is repositioned the position of the anchored-shape
 * should also be reconsidered.
 *
 * Steps to use a KoTextAnchor are; <ol>
 * <li> Create a new instance with e.g. new KoTextAnchor(myshape);
 * <li> Use loadOdf() to load additional attributes like the "text:anchor-type"
 * <li> Position the anchor with updatePosition() what will attach the KoTextAnchor-instance to
 *    the TextShape's \a KoTextShapeContainerModel . </ol>
 * The position of the shape relative to the anchor is called the offset. It's loaded by loadOdf().
 * @see AnchorStrategy for more information about the layout of anchors/shapes in Words.
