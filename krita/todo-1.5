Bugs

Also: see UIcomments!

Michael's bugs:

* Open an image, add image as new layer, resize layer, undo: undo removes the layer
* The change layer size dialog is not the same as the change image dialog, and should
  therefore be called the scale layer dialog. (Resizing a layer makes no sense)
* open an image, add an adjustment layer to the image (I used the pixelize 
  filter). Click on the original layer in the layer dialog box and paint 
  something. The undo the painting and undo add layer. Krita's toolbox will 
  become greyed out and you can't paint. I think this is already a bug and 
  should be fixed. But next, try to add an adjustment layer again -> Krita 
  crashes.

Regressions

? saving 16 bit grayscale to jpeg silently converts to 8 bit grayscale (actually it's not a regression, saving to both 8bits and 16bits jpeg with the same build is impossible with libjpeg)
? zooming in leaves display artefacts (see Bart's mail)
? rotate is broken for large images
? undoing rotate (from menu) when there is a selection active leads to weird results

Painting with filters

? sharpen: works badly, paints circles -- this used to be okay!
? small tiles: makes circles, otherwise effect is fun

Note: make kivio flowchart of what happens when painting with and without filters,
with and without selection, direct or indirect, because I don't follow anymore
