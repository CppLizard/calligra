Things left to do for the annotations branch


Features
--------


Bugs
----
 * Annotation shapes should be handled gracefully in stage, (and any other app for that matter)

 * Annotations should only be printed if the user want's it (different option to view->"Show comments")

 * The view has lost the horizontal scrollbar

 * The background of the annotation area should be more neutral in color


Annoyances
----------

 * Save and load status of "Show notes".

 * Zoom to Page Width should include the annotation area if active.

 * The review tool's annotation widget should have icons rather than text buttons .

 * Setting of "Show comments" also available in the review tool?

To Check / Test
---------------

 * Check undo/redo handling


---------------- Milestone 1: merge with master ----------------


More work
---------

 * Load more attributes, especially the styles.

 * roundtrip tests


Ideas
-----

 * Use color coding for different authors
   (This is probably already possible through the styles)
