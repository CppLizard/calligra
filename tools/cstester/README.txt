Compare directories
-------------------

1. To prepare for example a list of *.docx test files from your calligratests
working copy, type the following command:

$ find ~/kde4/src/calligratests/interoperability/kword/MSWord2007/ -name "*.docx" > files.txt

2. Prepare initial screen-shots to test against into an existing directory:

$ while read line ; do echo "$line" > /tmp/processing.txt ; cstester --create --verbose --outdir dir1 "$line" ; done < files.txt

3. Prepare verification screen-shots into an existing directory (after your
changes to the calligra source have been applied) and compare them against
initial scree-shots:

$ while read line ; do echo "$line" > /tmp/processing.txt ; ((cstester --verify --verbose --indir dir1 --outdir dir2 "$line") || echo "$line" >> failed.txt) ; done < files.txt

4. To compare initial and verification screen-shots, first a list of test files
with different screen-shots has to be determined.  Then the visualimagecompare
tool helps to inspect changes.  Type the following lines:

$ find dir1 -type f -exec md5sum {} \; | sed "s/ [^\/]*\// /" > dir1.txt
$ find dir2 -type f -exec md5sum {} \; | sed "s/ [^\/]*\// /" > dir2.txt
$ diff -u dir1.txt dir2.txt | grep "^+[0-9a-f]" | sed -e "s/[^ ]* //" -e "s/.check\/thumb_/ /" -e "s/\.png$//" > dirdiff.txt
$ visualimagecompare dir1 dir2 dirdiff.txt

Note: While scree-shots are being prepared, you can type the following command
in another terminal to see which file is processed (useful if you run into an
infinite loop):

$ tail -f /tmp/processing.txt 2>/dev/null

Note: Once the verification in step 3 is finished, the failed.txt file contains
a list of test files with different screen-shots between step 2 and step 3.

Note: To prepare a report after step 4, containing the name of the test file and
a sequence of page numbers which changed, use the following Awk command:

$ awk '{if (a==$1) {printf(" %d", $2)} else {printf("\n%s", $0)}; a=$1} END{printf("\n")}' dirdiff.txt > report.txt


cstester scripts
----------------

It is of advantage to create a directory structure as in the next example to
follow the explanation:

tester/
|-- checkdocs.sh
|-- verifydocs.sh
|-- documents/
|   |-- document1.odt
|   |-- ...
|   |-- document10000.xsl
|-- results/
    |-- sha-of-commit1
    |-- sha-of-commit2


To create the basis for tests and to inspect regressions in painting/loading
(crashes), type the following commands:

$ cd tester/documents
$ mkdir ../results/sha-of-commit1
$ ../checkdocs.sh ../results/sha-of-commit1
$ cat tester/error-sha-of-commit1.log

The error-sha-of-commit1.log file contains a list of test files, that either
crashed or got killed by the script as they used too much CPU or RAM while
being processed.

To check for changes between different runs, type the following commands:

$ cd tester/documents
$ mkdir ../results/sha-of-commit2
$ ../verifydocs.sh ../results/sha-of-commit1 ../results/sha-of-commit2
$ cat tester/verify-sha-of-commit1-sha-of-commit2.log

The log file contains a list of test files and pages therein, which changed.
The information can be used with the visualimagecompare script.  Use the
following format:

$ visualimagecompare file-name page_x page_y


cstrunner
---------

cstrunner is a tool to run cstester in multiple processes.  It creates a report
of files terminated by a signal.  This can happen as a result of a bug in
calligra or when the allowed amount of time or CPU usage has been exceeded.
The md5.txt file providing the ms5sums of generated thumbnails is created in
each output directory.  The following scripts are used by cstrunner:

cstwrapper - Limits the resources cstester is allowed to use and makes sure the
correct exit code is returned to cstrunner.

cstmd5gen - Generates md5sums for a given thumbnail directory and stores them
into the md5.txt file.

Please make sure this scripts are in the path when running cstrunner.

Run cstrunner

cstrunner docDir resultDir concurrentProcesses

e.g.

cstrunner . ../result/sha1 4

To run over all documents in the current directory and put the thumbnails in to ../result/sha1 with 4 concurrent processes

Do your changes and run it again

cstrunner . ../result/sha2 4

To create the input file for visualimagecomapre use the script 

cstmd5diff.sh <documents dir> <previous result dir> <current result dir>

e.g.

cstmd5diff . ../sha1 ../sha2 > md5-sha1-sha2.log

and then use 

visualimagecomapre ../sha1 ../sha2 md5-sha1-sha2.log
