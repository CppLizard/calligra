DETAILS (MS-DOC):
====================

sprmPFInTable (0x2416)

0x16

A Bool8 value that specifies whether this paragraph is in a table.
The value MUST be 1 any time the table depth is greater than zero.
See section 2.4.3, Overview of Tables.  By default, paragraphs are
not in tables.

----------

sprmPFTtp (0x2417)

0x17

A Bool8 that, when set to 1, specifies that the cell mark it is applied to is a
Table Terminating Paragraph (TTP) mark.  The TTP mark MUST be immediately
preceded by a cell mark.  See Overview of Tables.  By default, a cell mark is
not a Table Terminating Paragraph Mark.

----------

sprmPItap (0x6649)

0x49

An integer value that specifies the table depth of this paragraph.  See the
Overview of Tables (section 2.4.3) for the rules that this value follows.  This
value, when present, MUST be a non-negative

----------

sprmPDtap (0x664A)

0x4A

A signed integer that specifies an addition or subtraction to the existing
table depth of this paragraph.  It provides an alternate way of specifying table
depth to sprmPItap or a way to increment or decrement any value that was
already set by sprmPItap or sprmPDtap.

The resultant table depth MUST be non-negative and MUST obey the rules
described in Overview of Tables (section 2.4.3).  By default, paragraphs are
not in tables.

----------

sprmPFInnerTableCell (0x244B)

0x4B 

A Bool8 value that specifies whether this paragraph is the final paragraph in a
nested table cell.

When true, the nesting level of this paragraph MUST be greater than 1,
indicating that this paragraph is in a table which is nested within another
table.

When true, this is the last paragraph of a nested table cell and its paragraph
mark is treated as if it were an end of cell mark.  By default, paragraphs are
not the last paragraph of a nested table cell.  See the Overview of Tables
(section 2.4.3) for more information about nested tables.

----------

sprmPFInnerTtp (0x244C)

0x4C 

A Bool8 value that specifies whether this paragraph is the final paragraph in a
nested table row.  When 1, the table depth of this paragraph MUST be greater
than 1, indicating that this paragraph is in a table that is nested within
another table.  When 1, this is the last paragraph of a nested table row and
its paragraph mark is treated as if it were a TTP mark.  By default, paragraphs
are not the last paragraph of a nested table row.  See the Overview of Tables
for more information about nested tables.

----------

sprmPTableProps (0x646B)

0x6B 

An unsigned integer value that specifies a location in the Data Stream.  A
PrcData structure begins at this offset and specifies additional properties for
the paragraph.  The cbGrpprl member of the referenced PrcData structure MUST
NOT be less than 10.  If an application processes this PrcData structure, then
it MUST NOT process anymore Prl elements in the array that contained the
sprmPTableProps value.

SprmPHugePapx and sprmPTableProps values can refer to PrcData structures
containing each other, but the chain MUST eventually terminate in a PrcData
that contains neither sprmPHugePapx nor sprmPTableProps.
