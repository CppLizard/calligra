Things left to do for the annotations branch


Features
--------


Bugs
----

 * Fix repaint of lines when adding and removing text.

 * Lines remain when an annotation is deleted.

 * Possible to insert other things than allowed by the standard:
    - paragraphs
    - list entries

 * Default tool for annotations should be the text tool.


Annoyances
----------

 * Save and load status of "Show notes".

 * Zoom to Page Width should include the annotation area if active.

 * Insert/delete buttons mentions annotations, but menu has
   "Show Notes".  LO/AOO call them notes so the buttons should
   use the same word.

 * Use same shortcut as LO/AOO to insert a note.

 * Insert/delete buttons are too wide
    - better to have two textlines in them ("insert\nnote")


To Check / Test
---------------

 * Check undo/redo handling


---------------- Milestone 1: merge with master ----------------


More work
---------

 * Load more attributes, especially the styles.

 * roundtrip tests


Ideas
-----

 * Use color coding for different authors
   (This is probably already possible through the styles)
