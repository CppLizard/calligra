TODO
- javascripts to be further re-factored
- svgWriter.h should add the js to the svg doc
- More attributes to be added for frames

STEPS
1. Make libsvg accept an abstract document rather 
than just a karbon document
2. Make karbon link to libsvg rather than the stuff
in the svg dir.
3. Add a small method in SvgWriter to write arbitrary
tags and arbitrary content such as:
<a>
   b
</a>
4. Port the rectangle, circle, etc export functions to use
this new method.
