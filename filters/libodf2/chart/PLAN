Primary goal: Unify handling of charts in Calligra: filters and shape
Later goal:   Simplify the move to the new KdCharts and perhaps other backends


Part I: Move the charts to libodf2

Preparations
 * Move to better places and do some cleanups				Done
    + NumberFormatParser --> libmso					done
    + Charting -> KoChart,  --> libodf2					done
 * Change the namespace to KoChart					Done

Refactoring
 * Separate the definition of DrawingMLTheme from the ThemesReader.	Done
    + Move the data definitions into its own .h file. 			done
    + Only include the Theme definitions where the reader is not needed done
 * Make ChartExport into a base class and make inherited classes in:	----
    + Move baseclass to libodf2    	       		 	 	....
    + subclass in sheets/xlsx	   	  - using the DrawingMLTheme	done
    + subclass in sheets/excel/sidewinder - using the 2003palette	....


Milestone 1: separating useful parts into a library
----------------------------------------------------------------

Part II: Enhance the chart storage and use it in the chart shape

Enhancements of KoChart::Chart and the subclasses
 * Separate into separate files						----
 * Also read ODF (get from the ChartShape)				----
 * ...

Start using KoChart in ChartShape
 * Create a backend API and move KDChart into a backend subdirectory	----
 * Use the storage classes  	 	      				----


Milestone 2: Share common definitions and some data classes between all usages
	     of charts.
----------------------------------------------------------------


Other stuff to do, but not part of this plan:

 * Move XlsxChartReader to libmsooxml. (it's used in docx and pptx)
 * Move XlsxChartExport to libmsooxml. (it's used in docx and pptx)
