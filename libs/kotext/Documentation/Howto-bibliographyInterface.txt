Bibliography engines and Reference management software can use bibliography bridge interface of Calligra Words to perform 3 operations.

1.  To insert bibliography entry (citation) in document
2.  To insert bibliography entry (citation) in biblio database managed by Words
3.  To insert bibliography in document

To perform any of these operation, application must connect to KoBridgeServer through local socket. Calligra Words uses $HOME/.calligra/pipe.in socket file by default. After connecting to server, application can send/receive messages in JSON format in following way (protocol).

1.  Insert bibliography entry

    {
        "action" : "insert_citation",
        "fieldname" : "fieldvalue",
        ...
    }
    For field name, please refer to ODF specification v1.2.

2.  Insert bibliography entry in biblio database.

    {
        "action" : "insert_cite_record",
        "fieldname" : "fieldvalue",
        ...
    }
    For fieldname, please refer to ODF specification v1.2.

3.  Insert bibliography

	{
		"action": "insert_bibliography",
		"bibliography-source": {
			"index-title": "Bibliography",
			"bibliography-entry-template": [
				{
					"bibliography-type": "article",
					"index-entry": [
						{ "entry-type": "bibliography", "bibliography-data-field": "identifier" },
						{ "entry-type": "span", "span-text": ":"},
						...
					]
				},
				...
			]
		},
		"bibliography-entry": [
			{ "identifier": "GOT09", "bibliography-type": "book", "author": "George R. R. Martin", "title": "A Song of Ice and Fire", "pages": "280" },
			...
		]
	}
    
    To insert bibliography, application must set bibliography-source which is meta-data for generating bibliography index. It contains index title and entry templates for different 
    type of bibliography entries. If bibliography entry template is not provided, Words uses default entry template for that bibliography type. For bibliography-source, 
    please refer to ODF specification v1.2.
