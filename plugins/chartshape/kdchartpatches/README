This directory contains patches to KDChart.  The reason is that we
want to be able to reapply them to the next version of KDChart when we
upgrade to the next version.

Patches:

odf-marker-types.diff
  This patch implements missing marker types that are present in ODF
  1.1 and 1.2 but were not implemented in KDChart.
