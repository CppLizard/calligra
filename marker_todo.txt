- Use KoShapePainter to paint the KoPathShape with a marker
- If the point and the control point for the marker are the same use the last control point
- add support for different sized markers. This needs to be a property of the path shape.
- add support for centered markers
- load/save markers
- have a bunch of default markers
- Resize the repaint rect when the marker goes out of the existing one
- make the actual path that is painted a bit shorter to avoid artefacts in case there is a marker set
