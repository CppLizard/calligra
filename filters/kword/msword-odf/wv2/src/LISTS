DETAILS (MS-DOC):
====================

1. sprmPIlvl (0x260A)

An unsigned 8-bit integer that specifies the list level of the paragraph.  This
value MUST be ignored if this paragraph is not in a list (see sprmPIlfo).  This
value MUST be one of the following:

0x0 - 0x8 The value specifies the zero-based level of the list that contains
this paragraph.  For example, a value of 0x0 means that the paragraph is in the
first level of the list.

0xC The list skips this paragraph and does not include it in its numbering.  By
default, a paragraph is in the first level of the list.

--------------------

2. sprmPIlfo (0x460B)

A 16-bit signed integer value that is used to determine which list contains the
paragraph.  This value MUST be one of the following:

0x0000 This paragraph is not in a list, and any list formatting on the
paragraph is removed.

0x0001 - 0x07FE The value is a 1-based index into PlfLfo.rgLfo.  The LFO at
this index defines the list that this paragraph is in.

0xF801 This paragraph is not in a list.

0xF802 - 0xFFFF The value is the negation of a 1-based index into PlfLfo.rgLfo.
The LFO at this index defines the list that this paragraph is in.  The logical
left indentation (see sprmPDxaLeft) and the logical left first line indentation
(see sprmPDxaLeft1) of the paragraph MUST be preserved despite any list
formatting.  By default, a paragraph is not in a list.

--------------------

3. sprmPFNoLineNumb (0x240C)

A Bool8 value that specifies whether this paragraph is ignored when the
application counts or displays line numbers.  By default, if line numbers are
enabled, paragraphs have line numbers.

--------------------

4. sprmPChgTabsPapx (0xC60D)

A PChgTabsPapxOperand value that specifies custom tab stops to be added or
ignored.  By default, custom tab stops are neither added nor ignored.

--------------------

5. sprmPDxaRight80 (0x840E)

An XAS value that specifies the physical right indent of the paragraph, in
twips.  By default, there is no right indentation.

--------------------

6. sprmPDxaLeft80 (0x840F)

An XAS value that specifies the physical left indent of the paragraph, in
twips.  By default, there is no left indentation.

--------------------

7. sprmPNest80 (0x4610)

An XAS value that is added to sprmPDxaLeft80 to specify the final indent of a
paragraph.  By default, there is no additional space added to sprmPDxaLeft80 to
determine the final indent of a paragraph.

--------------------

8. sprmPDxaLeft180 (0x8411)

An XAS value that specifies the logical left indent of the first line of the
paragraph, in twips, relative to the rest of the paragraph.  By default, the
first line is not indented relative to the rest of the paragraph.

--------------------

9. sprmPDyaBefore (0xA413)

A two-byte unsigned integer value that specifies the size, in twips, of the
spacing before this paragraph.  The value MUST be a number between 0x0000 and
0x7BC0, inclusive.  When auto-spacing is supported and the value of
sprmPFDyaBeforeAuto is 1, this property is ignored.  By default, the space
before a paragraph is zero twips.

--------------------

10. sprmPChgTabs (0xC615)

A PChgTabsOperand value that specifies custom tab stops that are added or
ignored.  By default, custom tab stops are neither added nor ignored.

--------------------

11. sprmPOutLvl (0x2640)

An unsigned 8-bit integer value that specifies the outline level of the
paragraph.  This value MUST be one of the following.

0x0 - 0x8
The value is the zero-based outline level that this paragraph is in.

0x9
The paragraph at any outline level; instead, the paragraph is body text.

This MUST be ignored if the paragraph has an istd that is greater than or equal
to 0x1 and less than or equal to 0x9. By default, paragraphs are body text, and
are therefore not in any outline level.

--------------------

12. sprmPFNumRMIns (0x2443)

A Bool8 value that specifies whether a numbered list was applied to this
paragraph after the previous revision.  By default, paragraphs do not have
numbered lists applied.

--------------------

13. sprmPNumRM (0xC645)

A NumRMOperand value that specifies a numbering revision mark
for this paragraph. By default, paragraphs do not have numbering
revision marks.

--------------------

14. sprmPDxcLeft (0x4456)

A signed 16-bit integer value that specifies the logical left indent of the
paragraph in hundredths of character units. By default, there is no left
indentation.

--------------------

15. sprmPDylBefore (0x4458)

A signed 16-bit integer value that specifies the spacing before the
paragraph, in 1/100 line units. This value MUST be at least -20
and MUST NOT exceed 31680. By default, paragraphs do not have
spacing before them.

--------------------

16. sprmPFDyaBeforeAuto (0x245B)

A Bool8 value that specifies whether the space displayed before this paragraph
uses auto spacing. A value of 1 specifies that the sprmPDyaBefore value MUST be
ignored when the application supports auto spacing. By default, auto spacing is
disabled for paragraphs.

--------------------

17. sprmPDxaLeft (0x845E)

An XAS value that specifies the logical left indent of the paragraph, in
twips. By default, there is no left indentation.

--------------------

18. sprmPNest (0x465F)

An XAS value that is added to the sprmPDxaLeft value to determine
the final indent of a paragraph. By default, there is no additional
space added to sprmPDxaLeft to determine the final indent of a
paragraph. When present, this Sprm supersedes any value for

--------------------

19. sprmPDxaLeft1 (0x8460)

An XAS value that specifies the logical left indent of the first line of the
paragraph, in twips, relative to the rest of the paragraph. By default, the
first line is not indented relative to the rest of the paragraph.
