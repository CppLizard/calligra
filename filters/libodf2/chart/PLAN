Overall goal: Unify handling of charts in Calligra: filters and shape


Part I: Move the charts to libodf2

Preparations
 * Move to better places and do some cleanups				----
    + NumberFormatParser --> libmso					done
    + Charting -> KoChart,  --> libodf2					done
    + ChartExport -> ChartOdfWriter  --> libodf2 (see refactor below)	....
    + Move the chart reader to libmsooxml? (it's used in docx and pptx)	....
 * Change the namespace into KoChart					Done

Refactoring
 * Separate the definition of DrawingMLTheme from the ThemesReader.	----
    + Move the data definitions into its own .h file. 			....
 * Make ChartExport into a base class and make inherited classes in:	----
    + Move baseclass to libmsooxml    	       		 	 	....
    + subclass in sheets/xlsx	   	  - using the DrawingMLTheme	....
    + subclass in sheets/excel/sidewinder - using the 2003palette	....


Milestone 1: separating useful parts into a library
----------------------------------------------------------------

II Goal: Enhance this chart storage and use it in the chart shape

Enhancements of KoChart::Chart and the subclasses
 * Separate into separate files						----
 * Also read ODF (get from the ChartShape)				----
 * ...

Start using KoChart in ChartShape
 * Create a backend API and move KDChart into a backend subdirectory	----
 * Use the storage classes  	 	      				----


Milestone 2: Share common definitions and some data classes between all usages
	     of charts.
