The package contains:
blur_water
	A dulling smudge brush with jitter. Ideal for quickly smudging colours together, and when putting little pressure will make very smooth gradients.
smudge_round
	A round, pressure sensitive dulling colour smudge brush. A very good all-round painting brush.
smudge_wide
	Similar to above, but with a wider tip. Good for covering large areas.
wash_alchoholmarker_dark, wash_alchoholmarker_mid, wash_alchoholmarker_light, wash_alchoholmarker_wide.
	Brushes indended to mimick real-life alchohol markers. They all blend with multiply, resulting in very ink-like colours. Good for mimicking ink-washes.
